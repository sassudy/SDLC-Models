                        applied solely rather it can be merged with other processes and systems of a company like JIT,
                        make to order and scrum etc. making these systems more visible.

                        ineffective in industries where the activities are not static.

                        wastage of the company. Kanban system improves the flow and management of inventory by
                        directly assisting the company to pursue the companyâ€™s existing systems i.e. just in time (JIT)
                        and make to order etc. which reduces carrying or holding costs and makes sure smoother running
                        of
                        inventories.
                    </td>
                    <td>Kanban will become very difficult to apply if too much activities or tasks are interrelated
                        in a system. This is because such systems enhance the possibility of transfers of goods and
                        expertise amongst different tasks too often and increases difficulty to keep the pace of all
                        these activities.
